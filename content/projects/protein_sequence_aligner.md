A web app built using React and Javascript that aligns sequences of proteins.

A sequence alignment is a way of arranging the primary sequences of a protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

The app allows the user to align sequences using either the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm or the Smith-Waterman algorithm and also contains BLOSUM62 scoring or custom scoring. The app presents the alignment score as well as the optimal alignment.
